# Android Course Repository

This is a small repository I am using the save the programs and files created whilst taking the Udemy course by Tim Buchalka called [Master Android N App Development With Java](https://www.udemy.com/master-android-7-nougat-java-app-development-step-by-step/learn/v4/overview). I shall update this as I go, however do to a relatively busy schedule I may take quite a long time to finish. **PLEASE** do annoy me from time to time so that I get back to this!
