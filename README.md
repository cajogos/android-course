## Thanks to Tim

Would like to thank Tim for the awesome courses he has on Udemy, I was also on his old Android course and found it a shame I did not manage to complete it either, this time I am willing to complete his new course which he is still working on.

## Copyright and Attribution

This repository is mostly being used as a way for me to track my application development and uploading it here to share reference for anyone else doing this course. I sometimes heavily modify the code to avoid clashing with Tim's material. You should definitely [check out his course and buy it on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/master-android-7-nougat-java-app-development-step-by-step/learn/v4/overview), if you think it's too expensive I recommend you waiting for whenever there is a sale, as his courses seem to always be picked up.
